# Recipes-Page
--------------
Just a mini-project that gathers information from an API about meals. The page is fully responsive with a search-bar in which the user puts a certain ingredient in the input,
upon pressing the search button, all recipes that contain the ingredient are filtered. Further the user can click the "Get Recipe" button which opens up a modal which provides information about the meal's category and a short guide on how to prepare the meal. At the end of the modal there is a link which leads to a video tutorial on how to prepare the meal.
